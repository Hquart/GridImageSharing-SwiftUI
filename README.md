# Instagrid2

## Description

* Instagrid2 is an iOS iphone app realized in SwiftUI as part of my final project as a student in OpenClassRooms.
* The concept of the app is to create a personal images layout and share it.

## Motivation

* This app was first realized with UIKit as an OpenClassRooms project
* The present version "Instagrid2" is a clone realized with swiftUI for the purpose of learning and discovering SwiftUI.
